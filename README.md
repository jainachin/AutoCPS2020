Autonomy will become central to future Cyber-Physical Systems, as we scale existing systems and connect multiple systems together to address challenges in domains such as health, transport and energy. Modern artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies promise to improve every aspect of CPS such as maintenance, planning, optimization. CPSes can continually improve based on experience and adapt to changing circumstances.

Machine learning is already being used for various aspects of CPS, from recognizing human activities to robotic control. Much of the prior work has focused on supervised learning, where labels for each input are provided by a human, and a model is trained that learns the patterns in the data. However, in many CPS scenarios, these labels are expensive to collect on a large scale (e.g., autonomous driving) or not known beforehand (e.g., power transmission levels). This workshop seeks contributions where the model is continuously learning while the system is deployed using methods such as model predictive control, reinforcement learning, and behavioral cloning. The CPS community is slowly adopting these methods with applications to autonomous driving, HVAC control, medical intervention, and urban planning. Autonomous CPSes bring in a variety of research challenges: specification of constraints such as traffic rules, safety, high-assurance, risk-sensitive behavior, explainability of the model, transfer from simulation of the physical world to the real-world, multi-agent coordination. While these topics are being studied in robotics conferences such as CoRL, they are only beginning to be explored  in the much richer CPS domain and lack a current focused publication forum. 

## Call for papers

The Workshop on Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems (AutoCPS) seeks to bring together researchers to create solutions for the development of autonomous cyber-physical systems that can continually learn while being deployed in real physical and human  environments. As CPS applications are typically safety-critical, we seek contributions that address safety and reliability concerns. We propose to build a community of CPS researchers who are interested in frameworks, algorithms, tools, platforms, and testbeds for the development of autonomous cyber-physical systems. We seek contributions across disciplines - continual learning, reinforcement learning, control, human-machine interaction, safety, reliability, and verification. While papers being published in these topics are spread out across different conferences (IoTDI, ICCPS, HSCC, DAC, SenSys, BuildSys, Ubicomp, ICT4D), this workshop seeks to bring together these researchers to build a cross-disciplinary community focused on the common challenges in the domain.
